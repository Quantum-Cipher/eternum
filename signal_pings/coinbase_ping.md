🚀 Eternum Ping — Request for Genesis Push Grant

Hi Coinbase Dev Team,

Eternum has initialized. We've deployed our GitHub repo, Firebase logging system, and Ghostnode surveillance engine. The $ET369 token stack is prepped for Base L2, but funding is short.

🔐 Wallet: 0xe1517Fd7C1a4f1BB3dD8D6c33C3c9a02dcDf5BfA  
🌌 Site: https://eternum.dev  
📜 Grant Requested: ~$37 in ETH to finalize deployment

Backed by Zora’s WaveHack Grant, this is the final ritual.
