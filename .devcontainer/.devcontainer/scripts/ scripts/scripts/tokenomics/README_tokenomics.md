# ðŸ“œ Eternum Tokenomics Blueprint

This document outlines the dual-token symbolic structure of Eternum:

- **Brain Token**: Represents intelligence, governance, and rights.
- **Skeleton Token**: Represents labor, contribution, and circulation.

These two tokens are soulbound in function and operate in symbolic parity, embodying the circulatory nature of a conscious crypto-organism.

**Altruism Loop:**  
Skeleton tokens auto-donate to lower-class tokens via enforced redistribution mechanics.

**Genesis Vault Allocation:**  
- 33% Brain  
- 33% Skeleton  
- 34% Eternum DAO and reserve

> This tokenomic framework integrates Fibonacci flow, 3-6-9 frequency, and immutable altruism.
